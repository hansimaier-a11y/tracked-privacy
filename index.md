## Privacy Policy

_Last updated: December 2025_

This app is developed and operated by **Laurin Korber-Perner** (“I”, “me”).  
I take privacy seriously and try to keep everything as simple as possible.

### 1. Overview

- The app stores your training data **locally on your device**.
- The app can **read and write data from/to Apple Health (HealthKit)**, if you grant permission.
- **No account**, **no own cloud server**, **no advertising** and **no third-party analytics** are used in the current version.

If this changes in the future, this privacy policy will be updated.

---

### 2. Data processed by the app

The app works with the following categories of data:

1. **Training data you enter**
   - Swim sessions (date, distance, sets, times, notes)
   - Strength workouts (exercises, sets, reps, weight, tempo, RPE, notes)
   - Race performances (event, time, splits, stroke count, notes)

2. **Apple Health (HealthKit) data** (only if you grant permission)
   - Workouts (for example swimming, running, cycling, strength training)
   - Distance and duration of workouts
   - Heart rate data associated with workouts (average and time series), where available

All this data is stored **locally on your iPhone** in the app’s storage.  
The app does **not** send this data to any external server that I control.

---

### 3. Apple Health / HealthKit

The app uses Apple’s HealthKit framework to read and optionally write data.

- Health data is **never shared** with third parties by the app.
- You can control access in the **Apple Health app → Apps → tracked - pulse&pace**.
- If you withdraw permissions, the app can no longer read new Health data.  
  Already imported data remains stored locally in the app until you delete the app or use the in-app delete/backup functions.

Apple itself processes your Health data under its own privacy policy.  
Please refer to Apple’s documentation and policies for details.

---

### 4. Backups and files

The app can export a backup file (JSON) that contains your training and race data.  
If you save this file for example in iCloud Drive, Dropbox or on your computer, it will be stored under the privacy rules of those services.

I do **not** have access to those backups unless you explicitly send them to me (for example for support).

---

### 5. Analytics, tracking and advertising

- The app does **not** use third-party analytics SDKs (e.g. Google Analytics, Firebase Analytics).  
- The app does **not** show advertisements.  
- The app does **not** track you across apps or websites.

Apple may collect basic, anonymised usage data about crashes and app usage if you have enabled this system-wide in iOS. I do not see any personally identifiable information in those reports.

---

### 6. Children

The app is not designed for children under the age required by local law to give consent to data processing.  
If you are a parent or guardian and believe a child is using the app inappropriately, please contact me.

---

### 7. Your choices

You can:

- Remove Health permissions at any time in the **Apple Health** app.
- Delete all app data by deleting the app from your device.
- Export your data as a backup file and keep it for yourself.

I do not keep any separate copy of your data on my own servers.

---

### 8. Changes to this policy

I may update this privacy policy from time to time, for example when new features are added.  
The current version will always be available on this page.
