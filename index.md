Privacy Policy – SwimLog (working title)

1. General Information
This privacy policy explains how the SwimLog app (“we”, “our”, “the App”) collects, uses and stores personal data. SwimLog is developed and operated by a private individual (student athlete) based in Austria.

If you have any questions about this policy, you can contact us at:
Email: lkorber.perner@gmail.com
]

2. Data We Collect

a) Data you enter manually in the app

Training sessions (date, distance, duration, notes, sets, weights, etc.)

Competition results (times, splits, reaction times, stroke counts, notes)

Optional videos you add to a race (stored locally on your device or in your iCloud backup)

b) Data from connected services (optional)
If you choose to connect third-party services, we may receive:

Apple Health: heart rate, workouts, calories, other training-related metrics that you explicitly allow via Apple Health permissions.

Polar Flow: training data (e.g. sessions, heart rate, load metrics) as allowed by Polar’s AccessLink API scopes.

WHOOP: strain, recovery, sleep and other metrics you explicitly authorize via the WHOOP Developer Platform.

We only access this data to display it in the app and to help you analyze your training and recovery.

3. How We Use Your Data
We use your data for the following purposes:

To display your trainings, competitions and metrics inside the app

To calculate statistics (volume per week/month/year, pace, FINA points, etc.)

To compare sessions or races over time if you enable those features

We do not sell your data to third parties. We do not use your data for advertising.

4. Data Storage

All data you enter in the app is stored locally on your device.

Optionally, iOS may include this data in backups (e.g. iCloud backup) depending on your device settings.

If you export backups from the app as files, those files are stored wherever you choose (e.g. iCloud Drive, Files app).

If we add optional cloud sync in the future (e.g. using iCloud or our own server), we will update this privacy policy accordingly and explain exactly what is stored where.

5. Third-Party Services
SwimLog may connect to the following services, if you choose to enable them:

Apple Health (HealthKit)
Apple Health is provided by Apple Inc. Apple’s own privacy policies apply to Apple Health data. We only read the data types that you explicitly grant access to. You can revoke access at any time in iOS Settings → Privacy & Security → Health.

Polar Flow / Polar AccessLink
Polar Flow and the Polar AccessLink API are provided by Polar Electro Oy. When you connect your Polar account, you are redirected to Polar’s website to authorize the app. We do not see your Polar credentials. Polar’s own privacy policy applies to your Polar data.

WHOOP
WHOOP is provided by WHOOP, Inc. When you connect your WHOOP account, you are redirected to WHOOP’s authorization page. We do not see your WHOOP credentials. WHOOP’s official Terms of Use and Privacy Policy apply to your WHOOP data.

6. Legal Basis (EU / GDPR)
Our legal basis for processing your data is:

Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR – performance of a contract: providing the core functionality of the app.

Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR – consent: for all optional integrations (Apple Health, Polar, WHOOP) you actively choose to enable.

You can revoke your consent at any time by:

Disconnecting Polar / WHOOP in the app (if implemented)

Revoking Apple Health permissions in the iOS settings

Deleting the app and, if desired, deleting backups containing app data.

7. Your Rights (EU Residents)
Under GDPR you may have the right to:

Access the personal data we store about you

Request correction or deletion of your data

Restrict or object to certain types of processing

Data portability

Since all data is stored on your own device, you mainly control it by managing or deleting it directly in the app or by deleting the app itself.

You can also contact us at [your-email@example.com
] if you have questions about your data.

8. Changes to This Policy
We may update this privacy policy from time to time if we add new features (e.g. cloud sync or additional integrations). The most recent version will always be available at this URL.
